## Continuing where we left off..

After the dependencies have been installed, before we run our development server. Go into the .env.example file, copy and paste the variables into your own .env file created at the root of your project.

We will append the following variables:

- `DATABASE_URI=`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_LIVE=`

Right now we will access our Database URI via your payload project and navigating to the Database tab inbetween Overview and File storage as shown below.

Copy the Mongo Connection String and paste it in to your .env file as the 

`DATABASE_URI=`.

Next you can choose your Payload_Secret do something like:

`PAYLOAD_SECRET=speakuj_custom_secret`

Now we can go ahead and run our project in the developer environment with:

`npm run dev`

## Admin user & seeding database

Congrats! You have your development server up and running. It should look like the page below.

![Payload Dashboard](https://i.imgur.com/eoqLepb.jpeg)

Click go to Dashboard and now we can actually create our first admin user through our development environment... SO COOL!

For your `roll` make sure you select `admin.` Purchases can be left blank.

Congrats! This is your first look at the admin dashboard. There is a fantastic todo list as soon as you see the page below. Click the `Seed your database` and at this point if you go back to htt://localhost:3000
you can see the beautiful hero image and products, with their pages if you scroll down. Click [Shop Now](http://localhost:3000/products) to see all products. Note: if you are not hosting on localhost:3000, that link will not work.

As you click around you might notice the website feels a little slow, this is just in development. Your products, cart and database are ready to roll. Payment will not work until we setup stripe which is coming soon.

Now in part three we will be setting up the codebase and continuing on our journey with Payload CMS.
