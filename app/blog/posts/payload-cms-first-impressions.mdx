# First Impressions

Okay so after being exposed to Javascript Mastery's tutorial, I realized quickly this was the path forward for me. Between the admin dashboard & its easy setup process its a no brainer.
However then I realized the setup process had an art to it. My ADHD brain quickly realized I need to blog the process of going through this tutorial so that I can build mastery. 
Having this strong feeling I would be using this CMS over and over again, I went to my current tech blog www.cyber-gorillas.com and realized, this is an outdated format and Its time to jump into something a little more modern.

## My first mistake

I picked a blog template on vercel, something very simple, what you see infront of you now. I deployed, cloned from github, did basic edits so it would make sense, then decided now its time to implement the cms. Big mistake. Not saying
its not possible but that the headache was real. The magic is in the setup process on payloads website, so as I write this post, this will probably be one of the only posts I actually do in VScode as opposed to the admin dash in the future.

## Back to basics

I still don't have even close to a full understanding of this CMS so I will go back to the original tutorial via JSM, since I only went through the first 26 minuets of it so far, and I'm going to rewatch the first 26 minuetse, and blog the process as I go
from the very beginning. I'm excited to build this out. The tutorial is building an Apple inspired online ecommerce store. I will try to focus it eventually on getting fit as a gamer. I will sell products like a standing desk, and under desk treadmills, as well as computer parts and accessories.
