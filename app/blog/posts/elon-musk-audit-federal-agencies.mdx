I love everything about Trump and Elon teaming up. Trump tells the truth, and Elon allows the truth to be told. If you get these two cleaning up the government we will have a proserity unlike ever seen before.

## Elon buying Twitter was a historic aquisition

Elon Musk, after purchasing Twitter in late 2022, embarked on a mission to overhaul the platform, which he believed had stagnated under its previous leadership. He aimed to transform Twitter from a simple social media platform into a more ambitious project called "X," which he envisions as an "everything app."

## Donald Trump and Elon Musk record shattering interview

Elon Musk and former President Donald Trump recently had a highly anticipated conversation on X Spaces, the audio chat feature of the platform formerly known as Twitter. This event marked one of Trump's most significant returns to the platform since his account was reinstated.
It's been estimated that somewhere around 1 billion people have heard parts of the interview.
The conversation covered a range of topics, including Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, his views on the current political climate, and his thoughts on the state of the U.S. economy. Musk, acting as the interviewer, asked Trump questions that allowed the former president to elaborate on his policy positions and campaign promises.

During the middle of the discussion we had a very interesting and critically aclaimed point in which Elon Musk puts forth an idea for a Government Efficiency Commission in which Trump praised Elon for his clean up at twitter, though he didn't mention the company name specifically, said Elon would be the best at that job as heard in the clip below.
