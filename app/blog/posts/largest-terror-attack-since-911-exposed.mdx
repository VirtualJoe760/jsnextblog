## Shifting Celebrity Support

Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has shown a nuanced approach to political involvement over the years,
often remaining apolitical in the earlier parts of his career before gradually sharing more of his views.
His political support has evolved, and he has become more open about his preferences in recent U.S. presidential elections.

Dwayne Johnson's strong condemnation of the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump marks a notable shift in public support toward Trump, particularly during a time of national tragedy.
The incident, which shocked the country, has prompted renewed attention to political violence, and figures like Johnson, traditionally seen as non-political or centrist, speaking out against the attack has contributed to a broader narrative of unity in crisis.

## Previous Cycle Endorsements

In 2016, Johnson avoided endorsing any candidate publicly, emphasizing unity and encouraging people to vote, while keeping his personal preferences largely private.
However, by the 2020 election, he took a more definitive stance, endorsing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Johnson described it as his first-ever public political endorsement and explained that he had voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past.
He cited Biden’s experience and Harris’s leadership qualities as key reasons for his support, while emphasizing the need for a unifying leadership during a particularly divisive time in U.S. politics.

## The Rocks Political Ambitions

Johnson has also expressed interest in the idea of public service or even running for office, although he has remained non-committal, often treating the topic with humor.
Despite this, the possibility of a future political career has sparked much media speculation, with many seeing his broad appeal and centrist approach as assets in the political arena.
