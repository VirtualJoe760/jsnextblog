# Trump would releasing Epstein Client List

On September 3rd, 2024, Lex Fridman released a comprehensive interview discussing a range of topics with Donald Trump. In the 44th minute, Lex Fridman asked the former president why he had hesitation on releasing the Epstein client list.

"I don't think I had.. I mean, I'm not involved. I never went to his island, fortunately, but a lot of people did."

Lex then asked him, "Why do you think so many powerful people allowed him to get so close?"

Trump responded, "He was a good salesman. He was a hale and hearty type of guy. He had some nice assets that he'd throw around like islands, but a lot of big people went to that island but fortunately, I was not one of them."

Lex replied, "It's just very strange for a lot of people that the list of clients has not been made public".

Trump responded, "Yeah, it's very interesting, isn't it? Probably will be by the way. Probably."

Lex pushed again, "So if you are able to, you'll be.."

Trump interjected, "I'd certainly take a look at it. Now Kennedy is certainly interesting because it was so many years ago. They do that for danger too because you know, it endangers certain people, etcetera, etcetera. So Kennedy is a very different thing from the Epstein. But yeah, I'd be inclined to do the Epstein, I'd have no problem with it."

Lex concluded, "That's great to hear," then proceeded to his next question.
## Context for Kennedy comments

Trump previously in the video had discussed his intention to release the full Kennedy Assassination documents. Trump Announced this at an Arizona Rally with formal Presidential Rival Robert F Kennedy after Kennedy Endorsed Trump.

## Why releasing the client list is so controvercial 

Jeffrey Epstein was a financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and other crimes related to the exploitation of minors. He operated a network where he allegedly provided underage girls to numerous high-profile individuals. Epstein's activities were facilitated by his wealth, which allowed him to maintain properties like a private island and a fleet of private jets,
often referred to as the "Lolita Express." He was arrested in 2019 on federal charges and died in jail under circumstances officially ruled as suicide, though this has been a subject of conspiracy theories and skepticism. The best source of documentation regarding his clients has been his flight logs to his island where the majority of the abuse and trafficking took place.

## Key Associates Mentioned in Documents

- **Prince Andrew:** Accused by Virginia Giuffre of sexual assault, though he has denied these allegations. His association with Epstein has been widely reported.

- **Bill Clinton:** Named in documents, with mentions of his travels on Epstein's plane, but no direct evidence of visiting the island. Clinton's office has stated he had no knowledge of Epstein's crimes.

- **Alan Dershowitz:** Accused by Giuffre of sexual misconduct, which he has denied. His name appears in contexts suggesting involvement beyond legal representation.

- **Jean-Luc Brunel:** A modeling agent closely linked to Epstein, accused of trafficking girls.

- **Glenn Dubin:** Mentioned with allegations by Giuffre that she was directed to provide sexual services.

- **Les Wexner:** Former business partner of Epstein, instrumental in his financial dealings.

- **Ghislaine Maxwell:** Epstein's former girlfriend, convicted for her role in the trafficking scheme.

## Controversies and Speculations

- **Flight Logs and Address Book:** Many names surfaced from Epstein's flight logs and address book, but these alone do not confirm wrongdoing or visits to the island.

- **Misinformation:** Various celebrities and politicians have been rumored or alleged to have visited Epstein's properties, but these claims often lack substantiation. For instance, names like Obama, Oprah, and others have been falsely linked in social media posts.

- **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** The release of names has sparked debates on privacy versus public interest, especially concerning individuals not directly implicated in crimes.

## Bill Gates' Divorce and Connection to Jeffery Epstein

Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, and his wife Melinda French Gates announced their divorce in May 2021 after 27 years of marriage. Following this announcement, various reports highlighted that one of the contributing factors to their separation was Bill Gates' association with Jeffrey Epstein, a financier convicted of sex trafficking.
Bill Gates met with Jeffrey Epstein multiple times starting around 2011, years **after** Epstein had served time for soliciting prostitution involving a minor. These meetings were often cited in discussions about Gates' judgment and the company he kept.

Melinda Gates expressed her discomfort with Epstein during their marriage. She met Epstein once and regretted it immediately, describing him as "abhorrent, evil personified." This meeting and her subsequent nightmares about it were part of what she shared in interviews post-divorce.
In interviews, Melinda has indicated that Bill's relationship with Epstein was among the "many things" that led to their divorce. She voiced her concerns about this relationship, which contributed to the erosion of trust in their marriage.

## Justice for the Victims

Trump's comments on releasing the Epstein client list have reignited public interest and debate, the actual release would involve navigating a complex web of legal, ethical, and social considerations. It would be a landmark event not just for the victims of Epstein's crimes but for how society views and handles allegations against the powerful. The conversation around this issue reflects a broader societal shift towards demanding transparency and justice, yet it also highlights the challenges of balancing these demands with established legal and privacy norms.
